# Amazing Digital Cinema

A curated list of amazing resources for post production film technications in the digital cinema era.

This list was inspired by the [awesome-broadcasting list](https://github.com/ebu/awesome-broadcasting). Which itself was inspired by the awesome [awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).
In contrast, this list also lists amazing non open-source resources. To reflect this matter and out of respect towards the open-source only awesome list projects, I named this list amazing digital cinema instead of awesome digital cinema.
